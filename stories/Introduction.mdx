# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to **Talon UI**

**Talon UI** is a modern open-source component library built for **React 19** and **Next.js**. It provides production-ready, tested, and accessible UI primitives so developers can focus on building great appsâ€”not reinventing components.

Weâ€™re embracing the latest React innovations and making them accessible to everyone, with a focus on speed, flexibility, and developer experience.

> âœ… The goal: Help developers use **React 19** and **Next.js** confidentlyâ€”without rebuilding foundational UI.
